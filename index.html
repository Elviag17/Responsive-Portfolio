                    My name is Elvia Gutierrez and I am 22 years old. I graduated from UCLA in 2018 where I studied
                    Economics
                    and minored in Chicano/a Studies.
                    I now work at Bird in Operations but look forward to the day I can go into software engineering.
                </p>
                <p>In my (rare) free time I like to stay busy with friends. I love to drag them on hikes, shopping
                    sprees, and
                    bars.
                    When I am feeling too tired to move I enjoy binge watching shows on Netflix. I love anything
                    horror/crime/creepy so shows such as "Black Mirror", "Dark", and "Dexter" are my go to. Another lazy
                    hobby I
                    have is discovering new music and creating playlists.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apart from successfully finishing this program and landing an awesome job, I have lots of life
                    goals. To
                    name a few, I
                    want to live in another state for at least a year, travel as much as I can, learn how to swim, and
                    adopt
                    many, many dogs.
