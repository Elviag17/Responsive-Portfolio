        <p>
            My name is Elvia Gutierrez and I am 22 years old. I graduated from UCLA in 2018 where I studied Economics
            and minored in Chicano/a Studies.
            I now work at Bird in Operations but look forward to the day I can go into software engineering.

        <p>In my (rare) free time I like to stay busy with friends. I love to drag them on hikes, shopping sprees, and
            bars.
            When I am feeling too tired to move I enjoy binge watching shows on Netflix. I love anything
            horror/crime/creepy so shows such as "Black Mirror", "Dark", and "Dexter" are my go to. Another lazy hobby I
            have is discovering new music and creating playlists.
        </p>

        <p>
            Apart from successfully finishing this program and landing an awesome job, I have lots of life goals. To
            name a few, I
            want to live in another state for at least a year, travel as much as I can, learn how to swim, and adopt
            many, many dogs.
